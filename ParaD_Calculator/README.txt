The purpose of this app is to create a generic adding tool.

This application is formatted only for iPhone 7 at the moment.

The user input may take up to 10 numbers; however, the tool will display more numbers upon adding.

If you swipe left on the input and output view when inputting numbers, it will erase the last number that you input.

If you press “equals” more than once, the tool will add the last complete number that you input into the calculator.

After pressing “equals”, if you input another number without pressing the “plus” key, it will clear your inputs and start the calculation all over again.

If you have any input or feedback on the app, please don’t hesitate to let me know!
